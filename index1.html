===>>>>>>>>We can MERGE the branches toghether in code i.e. in main....again after adding feature or smtg..in 2 wayss

WAY 1: 
   - git diff <-branch name-> => will find the difference b/w the 2 files & then means ....to compare, branches , files and more
   - git merge <-branch name-> to merge 2 branches

WAY 2:
   - create the PR i.e. PULL REQUEST
   means it lets you tell others abt the changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on Github.
